            <!--Hello! I'm Kristi! I recently completed my <span class="emphasis"> computer science degree from Kent State University</span>
                in December 2020. I'm currently on the hunt for my firstentry-level position in <span class="emphasis">data science.</span> 
                <br /><br /> -->

            After working in the advertising world for four years, I decided to go back to school for another <span
                class="emphasis">bachelor's in
                Computer Science.</span> Seems like a polar opposite career move, huh? <br /><br />
                <!-- Advertising was a good
            introduction to the data
            science career I'm currently in pursuit of. -->
      

            My job in advertising was to recommend to the client how to spend their ad budget. I mainly worked with
            digital
            advertising, which has metrics associated with it. I used this <span class="emphasis">data to
                strategize</span> what media the client should
            use and to also report back after the campaign completed. <span class="emphasis">I came to enjoy the
                world of data</span> and wanted to work
            with it more than my job allowed. <br /><br />

            Around this time, I kept hearing about a field of tech called <span class="emphasis">"data
                science."</span> It seemed like more a fit for me than advertising was, so
            I made the decision to go back to school to get the STEM skills my original degree and advertising
            career did
            not provide. <br /><br />

            I recently completed my <span class="emphasis"> computer science degree from Kent State
                University</span>
            in December 2020. I'm currently working at Vertical Knowledge as a spider technician.
