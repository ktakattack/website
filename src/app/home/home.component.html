            <!--Hello! I'm Kristi! I recently completed my <span class="emphasis"> computer science degree from Kent State University</span>
                in December 2020. I'm currently on the hunt for my firstentry-level position in <span class="emphasis">data science.</span> 
                <br /><br /> -->

            After working in the advertising world for four years, I decided to go back to school for another <span
                class="emphasis">bachelor's in
                Computer Science.</span> 
                <!-- Seems like a polar opposite career move, huh? <br /><br /> -->
                <!-- Advertising was a good
            introduction to the data
            science career I'm currently in pursuit of. -->
      

            My job in advertising was to recommend to the client how to spend their ad budget. I used digital advertising <span class="emphasis">data to
            strategize</span> what media the client should
            use to meet their goals. <span class="emphasis">I came to enjoy the
            world of data</span>, everything from hypothesizing what media to use to explaining performance to clients in a an approachable way. 
            <br /><br /> 
            <!-- and wanted to work -->
            <!-- with it more than 
                .my job allowed. <br /><br />  -->

            Around this time, I kept hearing about a field of tech called <span class="emphasis">"data
                science."</span> It seemed like more a fit for me than advertising was, so
            I made the decision to go back to school to get the STEM skills my original degree and advertising
            career did
            not provide. <br /><br />

            I completed my <span class="emphasis"> computer science degree from Kent State
                University</span>
            in December 2020. I'm currently working at Davey Resource Group (part of Davey Tree) as an IT & Software Support Specialist.
