# Personal Portfolio
This was my first experience working with Angular. This is my personal portfolio, but a sort of sandbox as I keep updating and making changes as I come across ideas that I wish to learn. Here are some of the things this project has allowed me to learn:

* web page routing (how my site has a home page, a resume page and a contact page)
* creating a custom domain and hosting(using GitHub for hosting)
* creating a floating menu on /resume for easy navigation within a page
* source control--I use Atlassian's SourceTree to assist with source control. Whenever I'm making changes, I create a new branch. Once changes are pushed to GitHub, I use a PR to merge into my main branch. Rinse and repeat.
* deploying changes to a live site
